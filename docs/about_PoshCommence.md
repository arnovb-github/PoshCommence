## about_PoshCommence

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
PowerShell cmdlets for Commence RM.


# LONG DESCRIPTION
PoshCommence contains cmdlets that you can use in conjunction with the Commence RM Desktop Edition database application. 
It is a set of convenience cmdlets based on the Vovin.CmcLibNet assembly.

# NOTE
Vovin.CmcLibNet is a .Net wrapper for the Commence RM API. It was designed to work with a single active Commence database. The cmdlets in PoshCommence therefore (almost) all expect that a single instance of Commence RM is running.
